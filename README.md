# Deploying-an-Enterprise-Grade-AKS
Deploying an Enterprise-Grade AKS Cluster with Helm, Ingress, Key Vault, and Monitoring
Introduction

When deploying production workloads on Kubernetes, it's not enough to just “run a pod.” You need Ingress, monitoring, secret management, autoscaling, and network security — all done the enterprise way.

In this guide, I’ll walk you through deploying a production-grade Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with:
A multi-container app using Helm
NGINX Ingress Controller
Azure Monitor for observability
Azure Key Vault with CSI driver for secret management
Autoscaling with HPA
Network Policies for secure pod communication
Let’s get started.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have:

An Azure subscription
Installed: Azure CLI, kubectl, and Helm
Basic knowledge of Kubernetes YAML files

Step 1: Create Resource Group
az login
az group create --name aks-rg --location eastus

Step 2: Create Azure Key Vault and Store Secrets
az keyvault create --name aksKeyVault --resource-group aks-rg --location eastus
az keyvault secret set --vault-name aksKeyVault --name "DbPassword" --value "StrongPassword123!"


Step 3: Create the AKS Cluster
Azure Monitor
AAD integration
Network Policies
Managed Identity

Step 4: Connect to the Cluster
az aks get-credentials --resource-group aks-rg --name aks-cluster

Step 5: Install NGINX Ingress Controller

Step 6: Install Azure Key Vault CSI Driver

Step 7: Grant AKS Access to Key Vault

Step 8: Create SecretProviderClass

Step 9: Deploy Multi-Container App using Helm
helm create my-multicontainer-app
Edit deployment.yaml to use multiple containers:

Step 10: Set Up Ingress
Apply it:
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
Map your DNS (or /etc/hosts) to the Ingress external IP.

Step 11: Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
kubectl autoscale deployment myapp \
  --cpu-percent=50 \
  --min=2 \
  --max=10


Step 12: Validate Azure Monitor Integration
Azure Monitor was enabled during AKS creation. Go to:
Azure Portal → Monitor → Insights → Containers
You should see logs, metrics, CPU/memory, etc., per container.

Step 13: Apply Network Policies
Limit communication between pods:

Apply it: kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml


Final Thoughts

This is not a “toy” AKS cluster — it’s designed for enterprise workloads with all essential security, scaling, and monitoring baked in.
You can extend this further with:
Azure AD Workload Identity
Service Mesh (like Istio or Linkerd)
GitOps via Flux or ArgoCD
Private clusters with Azure Firewall
